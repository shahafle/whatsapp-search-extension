# ðŸ’¬ whatsapp search autofocus extension

**This extension improves Whatsapp web experience** and fixes the following problem:
When searching a contact in search bar and then deleting the text till search bar is empty it is lossing it's focus. One must click the search bar again to keep writing arter it's empty.
Thats a bad UX bug that making the use of it complicated and uncomfortable.

Then, I'm here to solve the problem ðŸ˜Ž.  
**The extension keeping focus on the search bar while using it and autofocus even after search bar getting empty**.

Whatsapp team may solve that bug themselves (one day or another), still this is a nice experience developing a **browser extension** myself.
